Description:  Wide hand pulled noodle with braised beef and spring onion root. New tangy sweet and sour sauce coating noodles
Score: 7.25
Experience: It's a good sharing dish, but its perfect portion for one person to be 80% full. Wide hand-pulled noodles were kind of chewy but you could bite through them easily. Braised beef was cooked well, not as flavorful as other parts of the dish, its just really well cooked meat. Adding chilli oil made it taste better
