Description:  Fried chicken with some seasoning spices
Score: 7.25
Experience: Great to share, will be monotonous if you eat it alone. The texture and crisp level was on point. Could've been slightly hotter, was still decently warm. Chicken was juicy, however, the inside felt like there was a lack of salt. Adding a bit more flavor inside would take this dish even higher. Serving with a sauce could also be great addition.
