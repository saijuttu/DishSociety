Description: Spicier version of Panang/red curry with pork shoulder. Served with lychee fried rice.
Score: 9.25
Experience: Flavor bomb of magnificence within the curry, pork shoulder is cooked pretty much to perfection. A dish worth fight over the last bite. Lychee fried rice is a unique pairing. If they get it slightly warmer this would be even better.
